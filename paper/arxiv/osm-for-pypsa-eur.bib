  abstract = {PyPSA-Eur, the first open model dataset of the European power system at the transmission network level to cover the full ENTSO-E area, is presented. It contains 6001 lines (alternating current lines at and above 220\,kV voltage level and all high voltage direct current lines), 3657 substations, a new open database of conventional power plants, time series for electrical demand and variable renewable generator availability, and geographic potentials for the expansion of wind and solar power. The model is suitable both for operational studies and generation and transmission expansion planning studies. The continental scope and highly resolved spatial scale enables a proper description of the long-range smoothing effects for renewable power generation and their varying resource availability. The restriction to freely available and open data encourages the open exchange of model data developments and eases the comparison of model results. A further novelty of the dataset is the publication of the full, automated software pipeline to assemble the load-flow-ready model from the original datasets, which enables easy replacement and improvement of the individual parts. This paper focuses on the description of the network topology, the compilation of a European power plant database and a top-down load time-series regionalisation. It summarises the derivation of renewable wind and solar availability time-series from re-analysis weather datasets and the estimation of renewable capacity potentials restricted by land-use. Finally, validations of the dataset are presented, including a new methodology to compare geo-referenced network datasets to one another.},

  abstract = {There are two competing concepts in the literature for the integration of high shares of renewable energy: the coupling of electricity to other energy sectors, such as transport and heating, and the reinforcement of continent-wide transmission networks. In this paper both cross-sector and cross-border integration are considered in the model PyPSA-Eur-Sec-30, the first open, spatially-resolved, temporally-resolved and sector-coupled energy model of Europe. Using a simplified network with one node per country, the cost-optimal system is calculated for a 95\% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to 1990, incorporating electricity, transport and heat demand. Flexibility from battery electric vehicles (BEV), power-to-gas units (P2G) and long-term thermal energy storage (LTES) make a significant contribution to the smoothing of variability from wind and solar and to the reduction of total system costs. The cost-minimising integration of BEV pairs well with the daily variations of solar power, while P2G and LTES balance the synoptic and seasonal variations of demand and renewables. In all scenarios, an expansion of cross-border transmission reduces system costs, but the more tightly the energy sectors are coupled, the weaker the benefit of transmission reinforcement becomes.},

  abstract = {Governments across the world are planning to increase the share of renewables in their energy systems. The siting of new wind and solar power plants requires close coordination with grid planning, and hence co-optimization of investment in generation and transmission expansion in spatially and temporally resolved models is an indispensable but complex problem. Particularly considerations of transmission expansion planning (TEP) add to the problem's complexity. Even if the power flow equations are linearized, the optimization problem is still bilinear and mixed-integer due to the dependence of line expansion on line impedance and a discrete set of line expansion options. While it is possible to linearize this mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) by applying a big-M disjunctive relaxation, the resulting MILP is still hard to solve using state-of-the-art solvers for large-scale energy system models. In this paper we therefore develop heuristics to incorporate integer transmission expansion and responsive line impedances in energy system models, while retaining the lower computational effort of continuous linear programming (LP) by applying sequential linear programming (SLP) techniques, relaxation and discretization approaches. We benchmark their performance against the results of the exact formulation for a policy-relevant case study of the German transmission system in terms of their speed-up in computation time, deviation from optimal total system cost, and similarity of line expansion. Using heuristics we reduce computation times of joint generation and transmission optimisation by 82\% with a maximal total system cost deviation of only 1.5\%. The heuristics closely mirror optimal integer line investment of the exact MINLP with considerable time savings for policy-relevant low-carbon energy system optimization models.},

A~hydrogen network reusing the existing gas network could not only help to supply the demand for low-emission fuels but could also balance variations in wind and solar energies across the continent and thus avoid power grid expansion. Our investigation varies the allowed expansion of electricity and hydrogen grids in net-zero CO2 scenarios for a sector-coupled European energy system, capturing transmission bottlenecks, renewable supply and demand variability, and pipeline retrofitting and geological storage potentials. We find that a hydrogen network connecting regions with low-cost and abundant renewable potentials to demand centers, electrofuel production, and cavern storage sites reduces system costs by up to 26 bn{\texteuro}/a (3.4\%). Although expanding both networks together can achieve the largest cost reductions, by 9.9\%, the expansion of neither is essential for a net-zero system as long as higher costs can be accepted and flexibility options allow managing transmission bottlenecks.},

First, in this contribution the importance and availability issues of grid data in the context of energy system modelling are highlighted. Second, this paper focuses on power grid modelling based on open and publicly available data from OpenStreetMap using open source software tools. Two recent approaches developed to build electrical transmission network models using openly available data sources are presented and discussed. The proposed methods provide transparent assumptions, simplifications and documentation of grid modelling. This results in the ability of scientists and other stakeholders to validate, discuss or reproduce the results of energy system models. Thus the new open approaches offer a unique opportunity to increase transparency, comparability and reproducibility of results in energy system modelling.},

  abstract = {Macro-energy system modelling is used by decision-makers to steer the global energy transition towards an affordable, sustainable and reliable future. Closed-source models are the current standard for most policy and industry decisions. However, open models have proven to be competitive alternatives that promote science, robust technical analysis, collaboration and transparent policy decision-making. Yet, two issues slow the adoption: open models are often designed with particular geographic scope in mind, thus hindering synergies from collaborating, or are based on low spatially resolved data, limiting their use. Here we introduce PyPSA-Earth, an open-source global energy system model with data in high spatial and temporal resolution. It enables large-scale collaboration by providing a tool that can model the world's energy system or any subset of it. The model is suitable for operational as well as combined generation, storage and transmission expansion studies. In this study, the novel power system capabilities of PyPSA-Earth are highlighted and demonstrated. The model provides two main features: (1) customizable data extraction and preparation with global coverage and (2) a PyPSA energy modelling framework integration. The data includes electricity demand, generation and medium to high-voltage networks from open sources, yet additional data can be further integrated. A broad range of clustering and grid meshing strategies help adapt the model to computational and practical needs. Data validation for the entire African continent is performed and the optimization features are tested with a 2060 net-zero planning study for Nigeria. The demonstration shows that the presented developments can build a highly detailed power system model for energy planning studies to support policy and technical decision-making. We anticipate that PyPSA-Earth can represent an open reference model for system planning, and we welcome joining forces to address the challenges of the energy transition together.},

The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},

It provides power flow, optimal power flow, state estimation, topological graph searches, and short-circuit calculations according to IEC 60909. pandapower includes a Newton-Raphson power flow solver formerly based on pypower, which has been accelerated with just-in-time compilation. Additional enhancements to the solver include the capability to model constant current loads, grids with multiple reference nodes, and a connectivity check. The pandapower network model is based on electric elements, such as lines, two- and three-winding transformers, or ideal switches. All elements can be defined with nameplate parameters and are internally processed with equivalent circuit models, which have been validated against industry standard software tools. The tabular data structure used to define networks is based on the Python library pandas, which allows comfortable handling of input and output parameters. The implementation in Python makes pandapower easy to use and allows comfortable extension with third-party libraries. pandapower has been successfully applied in several grid studies as well as for educational purposes. A comprehensive publicly available case study demonstrates a possible application of pandapower in an automated time-series calculation.},

This paper presents an updated and validated model that includes the Balkan region that was not included in the original model. In addition the model was fully updated to replicate 2009 power flows. The final results are positive and show an overall correlation of over 95\% when compared with the published cross-border flows from 2009. Power Transfer Distribution Factors were also calculated to show the problems of loop flows when considering large exporters or importers of energy. The database created in this project has been made available for public use by making it accessible from PowerWorld website http://www.powerworld.com/bialek.

  abstract = {[Summary] The dataset for the European electricity system needs a variety of data to cover the relevant characteristics of the industry. The more general data on aggregated generation capacities, historic generation, and consumption can be found with a consistent data specification for most European countries in databases like EUROSTAT. On the other hand, more detailed data like generation capacities for conventional and renewable sources are usually not publicly available, sometimes not even on a national basis, and henceforth appropriate assumptions or commercial databases are required to retrieve the necessary information. Due to the already mentioned issue with regard to available information, setting up a consistent dataset for the European electricity system is more difficult in comparison to the German electricity system, where mostly consistent data is publicly available. Similar projects on a European level could be helpful for a consistent dataset. Having set up a dataset for Europe, the model application shows that the general tendencies on regional generation and import/export pattern can be captured. However, differences are obvious in particular regions where the model shows different results than the historic values which may be based either on the rough modeling approach or on an insufficient data supply. To that end, the presented dataset and model application are a continuous process, and further steps are required to improve the data quality as well as the modeling. Among others, the implementation of cogeneration restrictions, improvement of renewable generation and their distribution, and an intertemporal model calibration are potential improvements for the future.},

  abstract = {The European North Sea has a vast renewable energy potential and can be a powerhouse for Europe's energy transition. However, currently there is uncertainty about how much offshore wind energy can be integrated, whether offshore grids should be meshed and to what extent offshore hydrogen should play a role. To address these questions, we use the open-source energy system optimization model PyPSA-Eur to model a European carbon-neutral sector-coupled energy system in high spatial and temporal resolution. We let the model endogenously decide how much offshore wind is deployed and which infrastructure is used to integrate the offshore wind. We find that with point-to-point connections like we have today, 310 GW offshore wind can be integrated in the North Sea. However, if we allow meshed networks and hydrogen, we find that this can be raised to 420 GW with cost savings up to 15 bn{\texteuro}/a. Furthermore, we only observe significant amounts of up to 75 GW of floating wind turbines in the North Sea if we have offshore hydrogen production. Generally, the model opts for offshore wind integration through a mix of both electricity and hydrogen infrastructure. However, the bulk of the offshore energy is transported as hydrogen, which is twice as much as the amount transported as electricity. Moreover, we find that the offshore power network is mainly used for offshore wind integration, with only a small portion used for inter-country transmission.},

  abstract = {A growing number of public and private energy buyers are interested in 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) procurement, which means that every kilowatt-hour of electricity consumption is met by carbon-free sources at all times. It has the potential to overcome the limitations of established procurement schemes, such as the temporal mismatch between clean electricity supply and buyers' demand that is inherent to ``volumetric'' matching. Yet it is unclear how 24/7 CFE procurement affects the rest of the power system, and whether this effect is consistent across regional contexts and different levels of system cleanness. We use a mathematical model to systematically examine different designs, optimal procurement strategies, costs, and impacts of the 24/7 CFE matching, both for participating buyers and for regions where voluntary procurement occurs. We examine mechanisms driving system-level emissions reduction and how they vary across regions and over time. Our results indicate that clean energy procurement commitments have consistent beneficial effects on participants and the electricity system. Utilising an hourly matching strategy, energy buyers can eliminate all carbon emissions linked to their electricity consumption, while also reducing system-level emissions by up to 572 kgCO2/a per MWh of participating load. Even as grids become cleaner over time, the hourly matching strategy contributes significantly to system-level emissions reduction. In addition, voluntary commitments to 24/7 CFE have a further transformative effect on electricity systems through accelerated innovation and early deployment of advanced energy technologies.},

Several associations are considering whether it would be more beneficial to build an HVDC grid instead. The main objective of the current study is to investigate possibilities and challenges in relation to the installation of a European HVDC grid. Most suitable technologies and possible configurations have been identified. Applications and existing projects of HVDC have been briefly mentioned. After examining various Supergrids models, financial aspects resulted challenging, since big investments are required. From a technical point of view, further research for DC voltage control and protection strategies is required. The publication of the HVDC Grid Codes represents a first step towards a European energy union; requirements are however not fully mandatory in all nations yet. The most probable development of the future HVDC grid has been defined: the grid is not expected to be built at once, but rather to develop in an organic way. In this sense, the installation of an offshore grid would be highly beneficial. Studies of possible supergrid architectures are still controversial and in part superficial. A solution to solve those lacks and achieve an agreement would be a strict collaboration between existing associations and involved European countries.},

They have higher costs compared to utility PV, but offer additional advantages, e.g., in terms of social acceptance. Here, we model the European power network with a high spatial resolution of 181 nodes and a 2-hourly temporal resolution. We use a simplified model of distribution and transmission networks that allows the representation of power distribution losses and differentiates between utility and distributed generation and storage. Three scenarios, including a sector-coupled scenario with heating, transport, and industry are investigated. The results show that incorporating distributed solar PV leads to total system cost reduction in all scenarios (1.4\% for power sector, 1.9--3.7\% for sector-coupled). The achieved cost reductions primarily stem from demand peak reduction and lower distribution capacity requirements because of self-consumption from distributed solar. This also enhances self-sufficiency for countries. The role of distributed PV is noteworthy in the sector-coupled scenario and is helped by other distributed technologies including heat pumps and electric vehicle batteries.},

The weather conditions responsible for these challenges have been well-studied in the literature. However, in reality multi-day resilience challenges are triggered by complex interactions between high demand, low renewable availability, electricity transmission constraints and storage dynamics. We show these challenges cannot be rigorously understood from an exclusively power systems, or meteorological, perspective. We propose a new method that uses electricity shadow prices---obtained by a European power system model based on 40 years of reanalysis data---to identify the most difficult periods driving system investments. Such difficult periods are driven by large-scale weather conditions such as low wind and cold temperature periods of various lengths associated with stationary high pressure over Europe. However, purely meteorological approaches fail to identify which events lead to the largest system stress over the multi-decadal study period due to the influence of subtle transmission bottlenecks and storage issues across multiple regions. These extreme events also do not relate strongly to traditional weather patterns (such as Euro-Atlantic weather regimes or the North Atlantic Oscillation index). We therefore compile a new set of weather patterns to define energy system stress events which include the impacts of electricity storage and large-scale interconnection. Without interdisciplinary studies combining state-of-the-art energy meteorology and modelling, further strive for adequate renewable power systems will be hampered.},

  abstract = {Modeling the optimal design of the future European energy system involves large data volumes and many mathematical constraints, typically resulting in a significant computational burden. As a result, modelers often apply reductions to their model that can have a significant effect on the accuracy of their results. This study investigates methods for spatially clustering electricity system models at transmission level to overcome the computational constraints. Spatial reduction has a strong effect both on flows in the electricity transmission network and on the way wind and solar generators are aggregated. Clustering methods applied in the literature are typically oriented either towards preserving network flows or towards preserving the properties of renewables, but both are important for future energy systems. In this work we adapt clustering algorithms to accurately represent both networks and renewables. To this end we focus on hierarchical clustering, since it preserves the topology of the transmission system. We test improvements to the similarity metrics used in the clustering by evaluating the resulting regions with measures on renewable feed-in and electrical distance between nodes. Then, the models are optimised under a brownfield capacity expansion for the European electricity system for varying spatial resolutions and renewable penetration. Results are compared to each other and to existing clustering approaches in the literature and evaluated on the preciseness of siting renewable capacity and the estimation of power flows. We find that any of the considered methods perform better than the commonly used approach of clustering by country boundaries and that any of the hierarchical methods yield better estimates than the established method of clustering with k-means on the coordinates of the network with respect to the studied parameters.},

Here, we introduce the python-based `powerplantmatching' (PPM), an open source toolset for cleaning, standardizing and combining multiple power plant databases. We apply it once only with open databases and once with an additional proprietary database in order to discuss and elaborate the issue of data quality, by analysing capacities, countries, fuel types, geographic coordinates and commissioning years for conventional power plants. We find that a derived dataset purely based on open data is not yet on a par with one in which a proprietary database has been added to the matching, even though the statistical values for capacity matched to a large degree with both datasets. When commissioning years are needed for modelling purposes in the final dataset, the proprietary database helps crucially to increase the quality of the derived dataset.},

The trade-offs that come with higher spatial detail between better exposure of transmission bottlenecks, exploitation of sites with good renewable resources (particularly wind power) and computational limitations are discussed. It is shown that solutions with no grid expansion beyond today's capacities are only around 20\% more expensive than with cost-optimal grid expansion.},

  abstract = {It is crucial for maintaining the security of supply that transmission networks continue to operate even if a single line fails. Modeling N-1 security in power system capacity expansion problems introduces many extra constraints if all possible outages are accounted for, which leads to a high computational burden. Typical approaches to avoid this burden consider only a subset of possible outages relevant to a given dispatch situation. However, this relies on knowing the dispatch situation beforehand, and it is not suitable for investment optimization problems where the generation fleet is not known in advance. In this paper, we introduce a heuristic approach to model the fully secured N-1 feasible space using a smaller number of constraints in a way that only depends on the topology of transmission networks. In our proposed approach, the network's security is modeled by comparing the polytope of the feasible space of nodal net power obtained from the security-constrained linearized AC optimal power flow problem. To approximate this polytope, a buffer capacity factor is defined for transmission lines in the N-0 secure case, thereby avoiding the introduction of many additional constraints. In this way, three approaches are introduced for obtaining a buffer capacity factor consisting of approximate, robust and line-specific approaches. Finally, the performance of our proposed approaches is assessed in different scales of transmission networks for determining the proposed buffer capacity factors, contingency analysis and economic evaluation. Moreover, we find that our proposed heuristics provide excellent approximations of the fully secured N-1 solutions with a much lower computational burden.},

  abstract = {The integration of large shares of wind and solar power into the power system benefits from transmission network expansion. However, the construction of new power lines requires long planning phases and is often delayed by citizen protests. As an non-invasive alternative, Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) offers the potential to leverage the existing grid by dynamically adjusting the transmission line capacities to the prevailing weather conditions. In this study, we present the first investment model that includes DLR in a large-scale power system with real-world network data and a high temporal resolution. Using Germany as an example, we show that a system-wide integration of DLR improves the integration of existing and additional renewables while reducing grid congestion. The evolving synergies between DLR and increased wind generation result in total cost savings of about 3\% of all system costs for a scenario with 80\% renewable power production, mainly due to reduced storage and solar capacity needs. If considering a fully decarbonized electricity system, the cost savings from DLR amount to up to 5.5\% of the system costs, i.e. 4 billion Euro per year. Our results underscore the importance of a rapid implementation of DLR in power systems to support the energy transition and relieve grid congestion.},
